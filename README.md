# Dicee or DiceRollerðŸŽ²

An application written to learn the basics of Flutter such as importing files into a project, 
random functions and working with Stateful Widgets.

## TechnologiesðŸ”§

#### - Flutter
#### - StatefulWidgets
#### - Random

## InterfaceðŸ’»

The project interface is a single screen with two images of dice displayed. 

### FunctionalityðŸ•¹

When you click on any of the dice, the random function is launched, which changes both images to 
random ones from the library. 

The image library includes 6 dice pictures with different meanings in PNG format. The random function 
generates a random value from 1 to 6 and assigns it to a variable that is built into Stateful Widget 
and points the image widget to the path to the desired image file in the library.

This creates an application that, when pressed, displays a random combination of two dice on the 
screen and can be used for board games or dispute resolutionðŸ˜…
